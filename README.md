# Biking-Analysis

The target is to cluster the orders of shared bikes.

Feature engineering is done in Preprocess.py. I use four cluster algorithm including kmeans, affinity propagation, DBSCAN and mean shift to cluster the orders.

Process and conclusion when tuning the parameters of each algorithm on the dataset is shown in param_tune.xlsx
